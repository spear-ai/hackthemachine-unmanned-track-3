The process for adding assets is currently a pain.
1. In Blender, each cube needs to be UV mapped to the texture atlas
	a) Open up cube.obj (in edit mode with render mode set to texture) and open the uv pane
	b) control-a select all, press G in the uv panel (turn on pixel snapping and object alignment in bottom toolbar) and move textures to the new square)
	c) save over cube.obj
	d) export to .obj
	e) Don't worry about the materials. We just need the uv coords, which are in the .obj (not .mtl) file
2. In Unity, the assets need to be imported and fixed up
	a) Import the .obj files from ./neural-mmo. Do NOT directly save from blender into this folder. A unity glitch will corrupt the project.
	b) Click on the model asset. Enable read/write in settings
	c) For each obj, drag it into the heirarchy. Right click -> unpack all. Then drag the "default" object out of the subtree. Delete the outer container. Rename "default" to the tile name.
	d) Make a prefab out of the object. Apply the atlased material.
	e) The object should now work with the loader and combiner
3. Troubleshooting
	a) If blender opens with small tool bars: edit -> system -> double dpi mode
	b) If the texture is wrong once you get the file into unity, you forgot to save the obj before exporting
	c) If you get a read/write error, import settings were not applied properly. If you applied them and still get the error, reload unity (bug)
	d) If nothing shows up in the render screen (and objects are not in the heirarchy) reload unity...

TL;DR: Unity is a buggy mess on linux
